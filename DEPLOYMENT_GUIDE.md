🧠 The Micro-Pest Optimized Pipeline

Unlike standard vision pipelines that squash full frames (destroying micro-features), this pipeline utilizes Grid Patch Cropping to retain 100% fidelity of extremely small objects (e.g., Mites) before feeding them into the ONNX Runtime.

2. Bare-Metal Deployment

Recommended for local development, rapid prototyping, and dataset collection.

# 1. Deploy the Target Pipeline (Choose Your Engine)
This edge architecture is highly modular. Depending on your specific agricultural use case, please clone the corresponding repository and execute the designated core script:

**🎯 Option A: Object Detection Engine (YOLO)**
*Optimized for localized bounding-box detection (e.g., Durian fungal spots).*
```bash
# 1. Clone the dedicated detection repository
git clone [https://github.com/xiaolin200206/Edge-Disease-Inference-Engine.git](https://github.com/xiaolin200206/Edge-Disease-Inference-Engine.git)
cd Edge-Disease-Inference-Engine

# 2. Run the detection inference engine
# Note: The main script is named 'edge code'
python3 "detection.py"

**🎯 Option B: Image Classification Engine (MobileNet + Patch Crop)**
Optimized for global leaf assessment and extreme micro-pest (e.g., Mites) classification.
# 1. Clone the unified classification repository
git clone [https://github.com/xiaolin200206/unified-agtech-engine.git](https://github.com/xiaolin200206/unified-agtech-engine.py.git)
cd unified-agtech-engine

# 2. Run the classification inference engine'
python3 classification.py

# 2. Isolate environment
python3 -m venv env_edge
source env_edge/bin/activate

# 3. Install edge dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Initiate inference engine
python3 core_inference.py

3. Containerized Deployment (Docker)

The mandated deployment method for B2B SaaS rollout, ensuring environment parity and isolated I/O operations.

3.1 Bootstrap Docker

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker raspberry
sudo reboot

3.2 Build the Edge Container

cd /home/raspberry/farm_edge/docker_env
docker build -t urbanfarm-edge-ai .

3.3 Spin Up (Headless Production Mode)

docker run -d --rm \
    --device /dev/video0 \
    -v /home/raspberry/farm_edge/farm_logs:/app/logs \
    --name farm-container \
    urbanfarm-edge-ai

4. Telemetry & Alerting Engine

To prevent "Alert Fatigue" for farm operators, the system employs a rigorous multi-stage verification filter before dispatching payloads via Telegram webhooks.
Alert Logic Gates:

    1.Feature Lock: Confidence score must exceed CLASSIFICATION_THRESHOLD (Default: 0.70).

    2.Temporal Lock: Must survive the Anti-Jitter buffer (3 out of 5 sequential frames positive).

    3.Cooldown Lock: Must respect the TELEGRAM_COOLDOWN_SEC (Default: 60s) to prevent spam during continuous exposure.  

  Configuration (core_inference.py)

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_SECURE_TOKEN"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "YOUR_TARGET_CHAT_ID"
TELEGRAM_COOLDOWN_SEC = 60.0    # Throttling limit

5. Multi-Tenant Service Management

How to seamlessly context-switch the Edge Node between different agricultural tasks using systemd.

# Switch deployment context to Basil Classification
sudo systemctl stop farm_durian_det.service
sudo systemctl disable farm_durian_det.service
sudo systemctl enable farm_basil_class.service
sudo systemctl start farm_basil_class.service

# Check health telemetry
systemctl status farm_basil_class.service
journalctl -u farm_basil_class.service -f

6. Model Over-The-Air (OTA) Management
⚠️ Critical PyTorch Export Bug (Pi 5 Architecture)

When exporting fine-tuned models from the Cloud/Colab to the Edge, you must force the legacy ONNX exporter. New PyTorch distributions split weights into .onnx.data fragments, which triggers fatal I/O overhead on the Pi 5's ARM architecture.

Correct Export Protocol:

import torch

# Force single-file monolith export for Pi 5 compatibility
torch.onnx.export(
    model, dummy_input, "mobilenet_v2_optimized.onnx",
    opset_version=11,
    export_params=True,
    dynamo=False,  # <--- CRITICAL: Disables weight fracturing
)

7. Audit Trails & Log Analytics

Every execution session generates an immutable audit trail for offline backend analysis and data-flywheel retraining.

farm_logs/session_20260226_150000/
├── telemetry.csv            # Microsecond-level performance metrics
├── lifecycle_events.csv     # Boot/Sleep/Thermal throttle events
└── captured_anomalies/      # High-res patches saved for Active Learning

Quick Edge Analytics (Bash):

# Check thermal limits reached during session
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {if($6>max) max=$6} END {print "Peak Core Temp: " max "°C"}' telemetry.csv

# Calculate true FPS throughput
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {sum+=$3; n++} END {print "Avg Throughput: " sum/n " FPS"}' telemetry.csv

8. System Configuration Registry

(Adjust via config.yaml or script headers)

Parameter, Default, Engineering Rationale
CONFIDENCE_THRESH, 0.70, Balance between recall and false-positive suppression.
ENABLE_PATCH_CROP, True, Crucial for Micro-Pest detection. Bypasses standard resize loss.
CYCLE_ACTIVE_SEC, 60, Sustained inference window.
CYCLE_SLEEP_SEC, 15, Thermal dissipation window to prevent hardware throttling (Limit: 82°C).

9. Edge Troubleshooting Playbook

Issue: RuntimeError: Failed to acquire camera: Device or resource busy

    1.Root Cause: A zombie systemd background process is holding the /dev/video0 hardware lock.

    2.Resolution:
    
    sudo systemctl stop farm_basil_class.service
    pkill -f core_inference.py

Issue: False Positives on Extreme Micro-Pests

    1.Root Cause: The system fell back to standard Resize(224) instead of Patch Cropping.

    2.Resolution: Verify ENABLE_PATCH_CROP = True is set. Standard resize evaporates 10-pixel bugs into noise artifacts.

10. Engineering Benchmarks: Native vs. Docker

Empirical validation for Academic & Enterprise stakeholders regarding containerization overhead on ARM Cortex-A76.

Methodology: A continuous 3-hour stress test operating under tropical ambient conditions, comparing Bare-Metal execution vs. Docker Containerization.
